Hello, today instead of working on my Jave project "PrintFRecreation" I decided to catch up on HTML syntax. Most of what I did I worked on in school today in CodePen.io.
I went threw the w3 page on HTML and I finished most of the stuff that I thought warented notes. I will upadate more in the future as I work on HTML more and need more
functunalitys. I was having quite a few issues with linking the HTML file and the CSS file so ill have to work on that tomorow, the CSS file seems to have no effect
but in codepen.io it does. Also today I started learning how to use Visual Studio Code because I dont wanna mess with a bunch of diferent IDEs. Thats what was causing
me the most issues, I still dont have everything figgured out but when I come back tomorrow to work some more in VS Ill probly figgure it out. See yall tommorow for
day 3! Thanks!
