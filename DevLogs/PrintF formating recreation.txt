Today is October 10th, I started the chalange today. I decided to start of a little ambitious and atempt to recreate the printf formating function.
Im not sure how to make classes or modules or anything like that so the idea was to just take an input from the user and effect the imputed string
but that seemed to be harder said than done. I worked on the project for arround 30 miniutes today. Im getting stuck on figguring out how long the
formating section is. I found the % but Im having truble testing weather the next varuable is a width or a different part of the formating section
I tried using parseInt from the Intiger class but im getting an error. Might come back to this later tonight but if not see yall tomorrow for day 2.
